As of this writing, the emulator at 8BitWorkshop doesn't accept numerical inputs sadly.

This isn't really to be taken too seriously. It was mostly written by ChatGPT for me to have something simple, but functional, to fiddle with and familarize myself with the workflow of IDE to IRL Metal. 

This repository was simply a convient way to save what I was doing.
